# CMSC434Impressionist
An impressionist painting app that lets the user upload a photo and use various brush strokes to create their own impressionist rendition. After the artist has finished their masterpiece, they then have the option to save it onto their device.

# How to Run
1. Clone the repository onto your local host.
2. Run the program on an Android phone or using an emulator.
3. Click the LOAD IMAGE button and select an image from your gallery.
4. You can now start drawing on the right side - this is your canvas. Feel free to change the brush stroke (currently only CIRCLE, SQUARE, and LINE are functional) using the BRUSH button. The faster you draw, the larger the paint is.
5. You can clear the canvas whenever using the CLEAR button.
6. Once you're satisfied with your painting, click DOWNLOAD IMAGES to add the image to your gallery.

# Bonus Feature
The impressionist screen has multi-touch implemented, so feel free to use more than one finger to draw.
